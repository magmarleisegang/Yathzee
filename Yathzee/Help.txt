How to capture input combinations:
Upper section: simply enter the number of dice of the specified value rolled
Lower Section: 
	Three and Four of a kind: Enter a comma seperated list of the three/four kind followed by the values of the remaining dice
								e.g dice rolled 3 3 3 1 2 will be input to Three of a Kind as 3,1,2
	Full House, Short/Long Straight, Yahtzee: enter 1 if the combination was rolled. The correct score will be displayed
	Chance: enter the 5 die values as a comma seperated list e.g dice rolled 1 2 3 4 5 input as 1,2,3,4,5
	Bonus Yahtzee: Simply enter 1 for each bonus Yahtzee. If 1 is entered but the Lower Section Yahtzee is still empty, 
					it will be set and the bonus value will remain zero.
To forfeit any combination simply enter a dash (-).
